# Roadmap

SQLStratum is in early development and currently targets SQLite. Near-term goals include:
- Stabilizing the core DSL and hydration behavior
- Expanding test coverage and real-world usage feedback
- Exploring a complementary DDL/migrations-focused library

This roadmap will evolve as the library sees more production usage.
